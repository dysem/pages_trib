  In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. 
  In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. <strong> He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.</strong>

                        <strong>1962–1967: Early career to debut album</strong>
 <p>  In 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15, named the Konrads. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and
  weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.
  When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star</p></li>

<p>
Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson,
Bolder, and Woodmansey at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him 
to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique—its influence lasted
longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.</p>

                      <strong> <li> Acting career</strong>  </li>                      
   <p>The beginnings of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, he was given the role of
 Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders)
 In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him.[226] The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 
 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra.
 In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg. Just a Gigolo (1979), 
 an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings,saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her Gigolo Stable
